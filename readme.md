## Some key points of the product

The orignial purpose of this subject is to teach students some general ideas on capstone project. This includes the coding skills and the communication skills with the clients. The clients were supposed to be master students who major in IT fields. However, because of the faliure of the communication with clients(no clients exist), so we decide to build our own project based on the suggeetions from supervisor. Since it is a student work, many imperfection can be found in the codes. We have already tried to fix the marjoity of them , but due to the limitaion of the time and resources we have, we cannot fix all of them. We are happy to see if you can help us fix them and let us know via the email: yuzyan@student.unimelb.edu.au
