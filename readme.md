## Introduction of the product

The general idea of the product is that when we are looking at the current popular forums such as reddit, we think that it could be better to have an independent forum which allows our users to focus more on the aspects they want rather than to be interrupted by irrelevant alternatives.

## Some key points of the product

The original purpose of this subject is to teach students some general ideas via a capstone project. This includes coding skills and communication skills with clients. The clients were supposed to be master students who major in IT fields. However, due to the faliure of communication with a client (no clients exist), so we decided to build our own project based on the suggestions from our supervisor. Since it is an academic work, many imperfections can be found in the code. We have already tried to fix the majority of them , but due to the limitation of time and resources, we cannot fix all of them. We are happy to see if you can help us fix them and let us know via the email: yuzyan@student.unimelb.edu.au
